# CreditScoring
ML project for Bocconi University. Addresses class imbalance in credit scoring datasets with data analysis, feature engineering, and ensemble methods. Implements resampling, cost-sensitive learning, and algorithm-level techniques for performance optimization.

Tools and Libraries:
The project heavily relies on the scikit-learn library, adhering strictly to default parameters for all pre-implemented functions. Decision trees with a depth of 1 are uniformly chosen across all models, ensuring consistency. The repository documents deviations from default parameters, specifically ensuring decision trees maintain a depth of 1 for uniformity.

Goals:

Address class imbalance in credit scoring datasets through comprehensive analysis and strategic modeling techniques.
Establish benchmark performance and enhance predictive models through ensemble methods and parameter tuning.
Provide a clear comparison of different strategies employed and their impact on final credit scoring predictions.
Key Features:

Comprehensive data analysis including feature engineering and outlier detection.
Utilization of ensemble methods alongside baseline models.
Implementation of data resampling, cost-sensitive learning, and algorithm-level techniques to address class imbalance.
Rigorous performance evaluation and parameter tuning for optimal model selection.
